# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

Based on a design brief from TripleTen, I was
able to recreate this 3 section webpage with proper
header and footer placements using html and css to
structure and style it accordingly.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Change reservation title font and size.
